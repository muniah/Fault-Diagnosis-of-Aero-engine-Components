# Fault-Diagnosis-of-Aero-engine-Components
This project focuses on developing a fault classification model to accurately identify various fault types and non-faulty conditions in aero-engines. It will tackle data imbalance. The outcome will be a fault diagnosis tool aimed at improving preventive maintenance and operational safety by distinguishing between multiple fault categories.
